# nand2tetris
Mostly completed project work for Nand2Tetris. Please feel free to use this repo as a resource if you're taking the course on your own! 

Everything is complete except for project 12, the Operating System, which passes the Coursera tests but breaks when trying to run Pong because
something is being thrown out of the HACK computer's memory range, but I'm burnt out and out of time to investigate further. 

The assembler (project 06)[], VM Translator ([project 08](https://github.com/sdixon194/nand2tetris/tree/main/08/VMTranslator)), and compiler (Chapter 10 and 11) were written in PHP.
