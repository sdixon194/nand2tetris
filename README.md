# nand2tetris
Completed project work for Nand2Tetris. Please feel free to use this repo as a resource if you're taking the course on your own! 

Everything is complete. Project 12, the Operating System, passes the Coursera tests but can be a big flaky when running Pong, more investigation needed to solve OOM problems.

The assembler ([project 06](https://github.com/sdixon194/nand2tetris/tree/main/06)), VM Translator ([project 08](https://github.com/sdixon194/nand2tetris/tree/main/08/VMTranslator)), and compiler ([Chapter 10](https://github.com/sdixon194/nand2tetris/tree/main/10/JackAnalyzer) and [11](https://github.com/sdixon194/nand2tetris/tree/main/11/JackAnalyzer)) were written in PHP.
